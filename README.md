- ðŸ‘‹ Please, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Naomi, also known as shutnik by some. I'm a CS student and I've been in front of a computer since I was 7 - and since then no one's managed to take me away from it.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogames, books, mangas, series and languages. I love reading about Ancient Rome (wow much original, very *intellectual*) and the history of Russia and eastern Europe in general.
